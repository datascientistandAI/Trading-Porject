# Custom Signals Reinforcement Learning for Trading

## Project Overview
This project implements a Reinforcement Learning (RL) framework for trading, utilizing custom signals to inform trading decisions. The notebook demonstrates how to create a trading environment, implement various RL algorithms, and evaluate their performance using historical market data.

## Key Concepts Applied

- **Reinforcement Learning Fundamentals**: Applied the principles of reinforcement learning, including agent-environment interaction, states, actions, and rewards, tailored specifically for trading strategies.
- **Custom Trading Environment**: Developed a custom environment using OpenAI's Gym framework, designed to simulate trading based on custom signals derived from market data.
- **Agent Implementation**: Utilized state-of-the-art RL algorithms, including Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), to train agents that can learn to make profitable trading decisions.
- **Market Data Processing**: Processed historical market data to serve as input for the RL model, including the generation of custom signals that inform trading actions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

To run this notebook, ensure you have the following:

- Python version ≥ 3.7
- TensorFlow version ≥ 1.15 (for compatibility)
- Required libraries:
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib
  - OpenAI Gym
  - Stable Baselines3

You can install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install tensorflow-gpu==1.15.0 tensorflow==1.15.0 stable-baselines gym-anytrading gym
```

### Running the Notebook

To execute the notebook, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository containing the notebook.
2. Open the notebook in a Jupyter environment.
3. Run the cells sequentially to set up the trading environment, implement custom signals, train the RL agent, and visualize results.

## Key Concepts Covered

### 1. Setup

The notebook begins by installing and importing necessary dependencies, ensuring the environment is correctly configured. Here’s a sample of the initial setup:

```python
# Install dependencies
!pip install tensorflow-gpu==1.15.0 tensorflow==1.15.0 stable-baselines gym-anytrading gym

# Import necessary libraries
import gym
import gym_anytrading
from stable_baselines3.common.vec_env import DummyVecEnv
from sb3_contrib import RecurrentPPO
from stable_baselines3 import PPO
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
```

### 2. Data Acquisition

Historical market data is obtained and processed. For instance, data for GME is downloaded from MarketWatch:

```python
# Load market data
df1 = pd.read_csv('EURUSD_Candlestick_15_M_BID_16.01.2023-21.01.2023.csv')
```

### 3. Custom Trading Environment

A custom trading environment is defined using OpenAI Gym, allowing the reinforcement learning agent to interact with market data. This environment includes features for defining action spaces (buy, sell, hold) and state observations:

```python
class CustomTradingEnv(gym.Env):
    # Define your custom trading environment here
    ...
```

### 4. Signal Generation

Custom signals are generated from market data to inform the agent's actions. This could include technical indicators, moving averages, or other market signals.

### 5. Reinforcement Learning Agent

An RL agent is implemented to learn from the trading environment. This agent makes decisions based on the current state of the market using algorithms like PPO:

```python
model = PPO('MlpPolicy', env, verbose=1)
model.learn(total_timesteps=10000)
```

### 6. Reward Calculation

The reward structure is critical for the agent's learning. The notebook implements a function to calculate rewards based on the actions taken by the agent, such as profit or loss incurred from trades:

```python
def _calculate_reward(self, action):
    # Implement reward calculation logic
    step_reward = ...
    return step_reward
```

### 7. Visualization and Results

The notebook includes visualization of the trading performance, allowing for assessment of the agent's decision-making over time and the effectiveness of the custom signals:

```python
plt.plot(self.df['Close'])
plt.title('Trading Performance')
plt.show()
```

## Conclusion

This project serves as a comprehensive resource for applying reinforcement learning to trading strategies using custom signals. By developing a custom trading environment and implementing an RL agent, users can explore the complexities of financial markets and the potential of RL strategies for trading success.
